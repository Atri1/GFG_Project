# GFG_Question_WebScrapping_Automation

## The aim of this project is to AUTOMATE the creation of company specific EXCEL FILES consisting of 3 Worksheets each : Easy, Medium, Hard using JS and Puppeteer.

*Easy has list of easy difficulty level of questions along with the links.*

*Medium has list of medium difficulty level of questions along with the links.*

*Hard has list of hard difficulty level of questions along with the links.*

### Now you can keep track of company specific questions without going to GFG Company specific section each time.

### Concepts in place : *Web Scrapping, Browser Automation*

#### I have used nodeJS and npm libraries for this project.

#### Sample excel sheet: Here its for easy, medium and hard questions previously asked in Wallmart >
